## Web Scraping in Python
Web scraping is the process of extracting structured and unstructured data from the web with the help of programs and exporting into a useful format.

## 3 Popular Tools and Libraries used for Web Scraping in Python
### 1. Beautiful Soup
**Beautiful Soup** is a parsing library in python that enables web scraping from HTML and XML Documents. Several webpages can be parsed using _bs4 python library_ and the data fetched from the pages can be used further in any of your favorite projects.
BeautifulSoup automatically detects encodings and gracefully handles HTML documents even with special characters. We can navigate a parsed document and find what we need which makes it quick and painless to extract the data from the webpages.
